UFC Champs Project

My phase 2 react project was on UFC Champions and their stats. I made cards for each champion the UFC has. In the home screen, you can see all of these cards. Each card has a name of a champion as well as a corresponding image.

When the user clicks on a champion, the user is directed to a route called 'details'. Here, the user can see statistics of the champions such as their record, their country of origin, and more.

If the user clicks back to "home", the user will be directed to the home route, where all the cards are present once again.

The user also also has one more option. On the top right of the page, the user can click on "Add new athlete". This will direct the user to the last route called "new". Here, the user has all the input fields they need to create their own champion. The user can enter their name, an image, their self made record and other information. Once the information is filled, the user may click submit!

Once the user clicks submit, the user will be directed back to the home page where the user will be able to see their own champion at the bottom of the page. The champion you made works the same way as the others. You will see the name and image of your champion in the home page. If you decide to click on your champion, you will be able to see all the stats you made for him/her!
