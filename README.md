UFC Champs Project

                        How to set up the app

First, you will have to copy the back end repo and clone it to a file on your computer. You will then have to cd into it and type 'code .' in your first terminal. Once this is done, the json file will pop up on your vsCode. 

Secondly, /* fork and clone  both para ^ to a directory where you  want it to be saved... */ you will have to copy the front end repo, clone it, cd into it /type npm install then / and also type 'code .' in your terminal. This will open up a separate window in your VsCode for your front end. You will be needing 2 terminals. Make sure both front and back end are on different terminals. 

You will then have to type 'json-server --watch db.json' on your back end terminal. 

Next, you will have to switch to the front end terminal and type 'npm start'. Once this is done you will be directed to the Website where it should be fully funcional.

My phase 2 react project was on UFC Champions and their stats. I made cards for each champion the UFC has. In the home screen, you can see all of these cards. Each card has a name of a champion as well as a corresponding image.

When the user clicks on a champion, the user is directed to a route called 'details'. Here, the user can see statistics of the champions such as their record, their country of origin, and more.

If the user clicks back to "home", the user will be directed to the home route, where all the cards are present once again.

The user also also has one more option. On the top right of the page, the user can click on "Add new athlete". This will direct the user to the last route called "new". Here, the user has all the input fields they need to create their own champion. The user can enter their name, an image, their self made record and other information. Once the information is filled, the user may click submit!

Once the user clicks submit, the user will be directed back to the home page where the user will be able to see their own champion at the bottom of the page. The champion you made works the same way as the others. You will see the name and image of your champion in the home page. If you decide to click on your champion, you will be able to see all the stats you made for him/her!
